# OSX Setup Scripts

This repository is a quick and effortless way to setup a Mac exactly how I like them for development.

To use the scripts, run the following:

```sh
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chattahippie/chattahippie-config/master/install.sh)"
```

After inputting confirmation a few times, the script will install the following:

  * `brew`
  * `node`
  * `elm`
  * `pyenv`
  * `git`
  * `wget`
  * `zsh`
  * `zsh-completions`
  * `openssl`
  * `mysql`
  * `cowsay`
  * `fortune`
  * `hub`
  * `thefuck`
  * `yarn`
  * Hyper terminal
  * VS Code
  * MacDown
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * `Monoid` font
  * `ionic` command line
  * `create-react-app`
  * `eclint`
  * `foreman`
  * `sass`
  * Oh My Zsh
  * Custom agnoster zsh theme
  * My personal zshrc file
  * zsh syntax highlighting
  * Hyper configuration
  * Powerline fonts
  * And my favorite VS Code extensions
